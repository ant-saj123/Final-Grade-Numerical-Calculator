# Final-Grade-Numerical-Calculator
This program allows the user to calculate their grades from hypothetical situations and calculate their weighted numerical. The user can choose of four different types of grades to calculate

Weighted Numerical Grade - The user can input the multiplier for different types of classes including regular, honors, AP, and Dual Credit. Then they can input the amount of classes, the type for each class, and their grade for each class to calculate the overall numerical.

Final Grade necessary to reach a Target Grade - The user can input their target grade, their current grade, and the weight of their final exam in order to calculate the grade they need to reach the target.

Final Grade after a Hypothetical Exam Grade - The user can input their current grade, weight of the final exam, and a hypothetical exam grade to calculate what their final grade would be.

Class Grade with Differently Weighted Categories - The user can input the different categories, their weights and their respective grades for the categories in order to calculate the overal grade.
